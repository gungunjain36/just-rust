# Just-Rust

Just-Rust is a collection of Rust projects designed to help you learn and practice Rust programming concepts.

## Projects

Each project is a standalone Rust crate with its own `Cargo.toml` file. You can run any project individually by navigating to its folder.

### 1. Hello World
A simple program that takes name input and prints greetings to the console.

**Run:**
```sh
cd hello_world
cargo run
```
### 2. Mutable Counter
A program that demonstrates how to use mutable variables in Rust by implementing a simple counter. The counter can be incremented and its value printed to the console.

**Run:**
```sh
cd mutable_counter
cargo run
```



## Prerequisites

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository (the central folder contains the GitHub configuration).
2. Navigate to the specific project directory you want to run.
3. Use `cargo run` as shown above.

Feel free to explore each project and modify the code to deepen your understanding of Rust!
