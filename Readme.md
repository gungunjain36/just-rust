# Just-Rust

Just-Rust is a collection of Rust projects designed to help you learn and practice Rust programming concepts.

## Projects

Each project is a standalone Rust crate with its own `Cargo.toml` file. You can run any project individually by navigating to its folder.

### 1. Hello World
A simple program that takes name input and prints greetings to the console.

**Run:**
```sh
cd hello_world
cargo run
```

### 2. Mutable Counter
